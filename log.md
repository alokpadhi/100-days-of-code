# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Write the html code part of a survey from meant to collect customer feedback.

**Thoughts:** I really never spent so much time to just write a fresh html code from scratch. Feeling great altough it's just the html part of the project, it's nice to have hands on this and looking forward to provide some good style to my project.
