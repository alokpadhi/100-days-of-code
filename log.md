### Day30: August 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Object Oriented programming javascript on freecodecamp

**Thoughts**: Practice, challenge, code and repeat. This is what I am going through now. Thinking about to start built something with pure javascript without any framework or library.

### Day31: August 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: back to functional programming javascript on freecodecamp

**Thoughts**: This is taking so much time to get acquainted with javascipt, but this is the real fun. spending more and more time to learn one thing, but just doing challenges is not enough, will have to implement these into some real action and learn by doing. 

### Day32: August 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Get started with javascript thing and the best project I could find for this is my own portfolio page

**Thoughts**: Testing some animations, some works well and some are really worse. But before I make it live these changes I will work on it more and then the final change will be commited and be live. Also take some js code snippets like browser detection, cookies and all to see how it works. 

**Link to My work**: [As no final change made yet so I am not providing any link, but these codes were pushed to my portfolio github repo]

### Day33: August 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: some competitive coding today on hackerrank, two problem solved, one from #10daysofstats and one from #30daysofcode

**Thoughts**: solving problems on these competitive sites are really great. this just chills out your mind sometimes but sometimes not. still a wonderfull way increase your problem solving skills. 

**Link to My work**: [Hackerrank profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/Alok_Kumar_Padhi)

### Day36: August 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: jquery revisit on freecodecamp

**Thoughts**: just to revise jquery. it's not like to build something new everyday rather to find ways to  sharp your skills too and it can be done in any way. either you use your learning to built something or do some excercise.


### Day37: August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: #30javascript: played with css variable using js(day 3) 

**Thoughts**: making css variables dynamic is really what you need in these days. you always aim that you dont need to go to several occurance of someting and make changes rather where you think this variable may change time to time, thats why using js for this really saves a lot of time.

**Link to My work**: [Drum-kit project](https://github.com/alokpadhi/30daysJavaScript.git)

### Day38: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: previous task continued as I tried to implement this for my portfolio

**Link to My work**: [Flex box galllery](https://github.com/alokpadhi/30daysJavaScript.git)

### Day41: August 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: #30javascript: Array cardio day 2(day 7) will do day 6 part later. 

**Thoughts**: more array and its heavy. bit more coding excercise but not that much. that's it for today.

**Link to My work**: [array cardio day 2](https://github.com/alokpadhi/30daysJavaScript.git)

### Day42: August 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: machine learning time logitstic regression, softmax regression and svm  
**Thoughts**: A lot of time on machine learning only. logistic, softmax done. svm on andrew ng courese done. ready to do some more practical work using svm.


### Day43: August 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: svm on udacity. and naive bayes on udacity too

**Thoughts**: naive bayes completed on udacity with a text classification using naive bayes with a 0.97 test accuracy.

### Day44: August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: svm section completed on udacity intro to ml 

**Thoughts**: Success fully implemented svm on the mini project and the accuracy is: 0.98

### Day45: August 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Played with iris data set 

**Thoughts**: Exploring and learning svm, so tried svm with the iris data set as this one of the basic classification task. and through this it really helps to understand what svm doing with the data.

### Day46: August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Decision tree started with iris data set and also decision tree on udacity's intro to ml

**Thoughts**: so its decision tree applied on iris data set. graphviz helps to draw a decision tree using sklearn. understand different parameters generated at each node like samples, values, gini. though i did not tried with entropy criteria as i feel gini is well enough. then started the decision tree section on udacity.

### Day47: August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Decision tree completed on udacity, overfitting and bias-variance dilema

**Thoughts**: So with decision tree algorithm I got 97% accuracy on the terrain data. well not good than svm but I think with tweaking some hyper para meters I can predict a better score. like reducing max_feature, increasing min_samples_leaf etc. but still 97% accuracy not bad though.

### Day48: August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: started with ensemble learning, bagging and random forest and Choose your own algorithm on Udacity

**Thoughts**: well to test all these algorithm what I have learned, I used make_moon dataset from sklearn. They give fairly good understanding with VotingClassifier, BaggingClassifier and RandomForestClassifier. Then move to udacity to pick one algorithm of your own. I choose RandomForest and applied it to terrain data and got 92% accuracy and sadly I failed to beat the self driving score of 93.6%. I tried with tweaking some of hyper parameters but not getting good score than 92%. Also my oob_score was about 96%. but will try adaboost to see how it predicts.


### Day49: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Ensemble learning continues with Adaboost. and applied on the #udacity intro to ml mini project

**Thoughts**: Adaboost really wonderful. Its one of the best time when I learned Adaboost. What's so cool about is the way it improvise upon a weak learner. Found some similarity with neural nets. The way it updated weights I mean incresing and decreasing as per necessity. and one more thing is to there aren't many hyperparameters as in RandomForest. Finally adaboost on the terrain data of udacity. and guess what I got 93.2% accuracy score, whereas their accuracy score was 93.6%. Hmm I might try out to learn a car for self driving. But dissapointed as I failed to beat that score.

### Day50: August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Ensemble learning Finished. Gradient boosting learned. 
**Thoughts**: So this is the day where I learned almost important supervised learning algorithms. To end this Gradient boosting technique. not a heavy day of coding but still its something to implement.

### Day51: August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Dimensinality reduction technique. projection and manifold. #udacity intro to ml datasets POI

**Thoughts**: PCA to reduce dimensions. and exploring interest info on the enron datasets. so called POI in the udacity intro to ml course. some basic intutive and some coding to answer question.

### Day52: August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  So POI on enron data continues.

**Thoughts**: Exploring more information on the enron dataset. moreover go deeper into the problem and did a case study, which will helps to analyse the problem domain and interest of features and targets.

### Day53: August 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Diggind enron dataset finished. move to regression part. Python coding: Numpy, list and package

**Thoughts**: Regression analysis on the enron dataset.Used Sum of squares and r2 score to analysis the prediction. then some python coding on nummpy. explored list part on datacamp.

### Day54: August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Improve r2 score on enron dataset. python coding: matplotlib, hist(), tick, scatter(), labels, customizing plots

**Thoughts**: As at a very stage using r2 on the enron provides really bad score. then working out on the outliers provides a better result. and with this regression section finished for the udacity intro to ml section. some visualization learned using matplotlib. scatter plot, histogram, and bit more customization.

### Day55: september 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Pandas dataframe and series, outlier detection

**Thoughts**: as I was using outlier on regression but that does not yield a better scope of outlier insight. so learning more detailed about outlier. one simple algorithm to work on outlier. some times outliers matters so it depens on the problem. and look into the outliers either they providing some valuable info or nor. then some pandas series and dataframes. python dicionary.

### Day56: September 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Looping over pandas dataframe and a random walk simulation

**Thoughts**: Learned how to looping over numpy and pandas efficiently. a emperor state building step reaching simulation. using random walks,(numpy random) a simulation to predict what is the probability that you will reach at 60 step after the dice has been rolled. so the distribution probabilty says: 78.4%


### Day57: September 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  basic intermediate python skills to make a adwords for a furniture company

### Day62: September 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  worked with relational databases file importing, imported from web by scraping using various python libraries.

**Thoughts**: collecting data from relational databases & store them as pandas data frame. import data from the web using urllib, requests. import files through HTTP requests using urllib & requests. then scrap web using BeautifulSoup, apis & json.

**Take Away**: sql_alchemy, create database engine and then use that engine to read database using sql query and then convert to pandas dataframe. urllib , requests. BeautifulSoup(), Soup.title, Soup.get_text(), Soup.findall(), json.
